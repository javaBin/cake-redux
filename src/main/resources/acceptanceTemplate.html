<h2>JourneyZone REGISTRATION</h2>
<p>Our famous post-conference tour - JourneyZone - is going to be organised again this year and this year the journey is not only going to take you into the Norwegian wilderness, but also back in time! You can find more information about the tour <a href="https://2024.javazone.no/speakers/journeyzone">here</a>.</p>
<p>The number of spots is limited and if you want to participate, you need to apply <a href="https://forms.gle/MvNqtaUHL3bWrQVC9">here</a>. The deadline for your application is Wednesday, June 26th, so please be quick. We will let the participants who got a spot know shortly after so that these who need to buy plane tickets, can plan their stay accordingly.</p>
    
<h2>OTHER PRACTICAL INFORMATION</h2>
    
<h3>1) Tickets:</h3>
<p>All speakers receive a free ticket for the conference, which can be collected when you arrive at Oslo Spektrum. This includes the workshop day prior to the conference. Please note that if you wish to join one of the workshops as a participant, you have to register for the workshop just like any regular ticket holder would do.</p>
    
<h3>2) Reimbursements:</h3>
<p>Being a speaker at JavaZone does not automatically make you eligible for reimbursement. Instead, you have to apply for reimbursement. Please see <a href="https://2024.javazone.no/speakers/monetary-policy">https://2024.javazone.no/speakers/monetary-policy</a> for information about how you can apply (the deadline is August 1). Please note that we do not provide reimbursement to lightning-talk speakers.</p>

<h3>3) Speakers' dinner:</h3>
<p>As always, we'll be hosting a speakers' dinner the evening before JavaZone. Please indicate whether you'll attend or not when confirming your talk. You can expect more information about this in August.</p>

<h3>3) Your attendance:</h3>
<p>We always hope that our speakers stay with us for the whole conference and get the most out of JavaZone. However, if you only can stay for one of the days or will be arriving late on Wednesday or leaving early on Thursday, please let us know and we will make sure to schedule your talk in a way that works best for you.</p>
<p>If you are giving a workshop, please remember that all workshops are being held on Tuesday, September 3. This means that if you are traveling to Oslo, you need to plan your travel so that you are in Oslo the whole Tuesday.</p>
