<h2>A NOTE ABOUT COVID</h2>

<p>Most people in Norway are fully vaccinated, and most covid-related restrictions were recently lifted. The only restrictions that remain relate to international travel. However, if you can present proof of vaccination or undergone infection, there should be no problem.</p>

<p>Please note that if you need to travel internationally to reach the conference, you bear the responsibility to provide the requisite documentation for entry into Norway. Remember that there might be different rules that apply depending on your country of origin.</p>


<h2>OTHER PRACTICAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>All speakers receive a free ticket for the conference, which will be sent out in a later email. This includes the workshop day prior to the conference. Please note that if you wish to join one of the workshops as a participant, you have to register for the workshop just like any regular ticket holder would do.</p>
